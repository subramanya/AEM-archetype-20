Open the folder crx-quickstart/opt of AEM 6.3 installation.
You will find folder filevault.
Inside filevault you will find the  files filevault-3.1.38.tgz and filevault-3.1.38.zip.
unzip the appropriate file on your host laptop( filevault-3.1.38.tgz for mac and filevault-3.1.38.zip for windows).
If you have any AEM source code and if it is already deployed to AEM.
Then you can sync the ui.apps folder's jcr_root folder filesystem with AEM repository on AEM server so that you 
need not do the build and deploy using maven commands everytime you change the UI code.

Steps are given below
Configure your laptop/system to exucute vlt command from "cmd" on windows and "terminal" on Mac.

Let us take example of sample project having name "mycompany"
The path of the folder inside /apps folder is /apps/company
Now when you have created a the mycompany using adobe's archetype.
The archetype creates the project as per Adobe's standard.

Inside your created project folder go to ui.apps folder
 Then cd to content/src/main/content/jcr_root and run :
 vlt --credentials admin:admin checkout -f ../META-INF/vault/filter.xml --force http://localhost:4502/crx
 
 This will sync your local UI folders like /apps, /conf, /content , /etc folders with AEM server.
 
 Every time you modify a file use the below command to put the chagnes to AEM
 
 vlt ci
 
 If you happen to crete a new file anywhere in /apps or /conf or /etc.
 
 first you have to execute below command from ui.apps/content/src/main/content/jcr_root folder
 
 vlt add <path of the file>
 For example if the path of the file is -->pps/mycompany/components/content/articleslist/test.html
 Then execute below commands:
 vlt add apps/weretail/components/content/articleslist/test.html
 vlt ci 
 
 If you do any changes to a file on AEM's crx/de/index.jsp(crx console), then execute below command on local file system 
 from ui.apps/content/src/main/content/jcr_root folder
 vlt up
 
 Hope this helps us to put the changes to AEM and the changes from AEM without executing time consuming mvn clean install commands

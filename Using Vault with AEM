Open the folder crx-quickstart/opt of AEM 6.3 installation.
You will find folder filevault.
Inside filevault you will find the files filevault-3.1.38.tgz and filevault-3.1.38.zip. You can unzip the appropriate file on your host laptop( filevault-3.1.38.tgz for mac and filevault-3.1.38.zip for windows).

If you have any AEM source code and if it is already deployed to AEM.

Then you can sync the ui.apps folder's jcr_root folder filesystem with AEM repository on AEM server so that you need not do the build and deploy using maven commands everytime you change the UI code.

  To configure your laptop/system to execute vlt command from "cmd" on windows or "terminal" on Mac, steps are given below:

Let us take example of sample project having name "mycompany".
Assuming  you have created a aem project having name mycompany using adobe's archetype.
The archetype creates the project as per Adobe's standard. 
The path of the mycompany folder inside /apps folder is : /apps/company.
Inside your created project folder go to ui.apps folder 
Then cd to content/src/main/content/jcr_root 
For  ui.apps/content/src/main/content/jcr_root run below command
   vlt --credentials admin:admin checkout -f ../META-INF/vault/filter.xml --force http://localhost:4502/crx 
Above command will sync your local UI folders like /apps, /conf, /content , /etc folders with AEM server. 

Every time you modify a file use the below command to put the changes to AEM 
     vlt ci 
SYNCING NEW files into AEM: 
If you happen to create a new file anywhere in /apps or /conf or /etc. 
First you have to execute below commans from ui.apps/content/src/main/content/jcr_root folder  
       vlt add <path of the file> , then followed by 
        vlt ci (vault commit) 
For example: 
       if the path of the file is -->pps/mycompany/components/content/articleslist/test.html,
     then execute below 2 commands: 
      vlt add apps/weretail/components/content/articleslist/test.html 
      vlt ci 

If you do any changes to a file on AEM, using  crx/de/index.jsp(crx console), 
then execute below command on local file system from folder: ui.apps/content/src/main/content/jcr_root 
    vlt up 
Hope this helps us to put the changes to AEM and the changes from AEM without executing the time consuming mvn clean install commands  and mvn clean install -PautoInstallPackage commands for UI code changes during development and save devbeloperâ€™s time .
